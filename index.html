        <p>
          My name is Elena Nemirovskaya and I am a passionate web developer
          currently pursuing my associate degree at Oakland Community College.
          My journey into web development began with a natural curiosity about
          the internet and a desire to innovate in the digital realm. Through my
          coursework and personal projects, I've mastered languages like HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks. I stay
          committed to staying current with industry trends and emerging
          technologies, as the web development landscape is ever-evolving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oakland Community College has provided me with a strong foundation to
          further develop my skills, and I'm eager to continue growing as a web
          developer. My ultimate goal is to use my expertise to create
          user-friendly, visually engaging websites and applications that meet
          client needs and leave a positive mark on the digital world.
